libcmyth test code
------------------

This directory contains test programs for C++ and the SWIG language bindings
built upon libcppmyth.  The bash scripts assume that you have successfully
built all of libcmyth, and that you have a MythTV server running on
"localhost".

In order to override the default MythTV server, provide it as an argument to
the bash script.

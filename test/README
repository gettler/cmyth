libcmyth test code
------------------

This directory contains test programs for C++ and the SWIG language bindings
built upon libcppmyth.  The bash scripts assume that you have installed
libcmyth into a directory called "install" at the top of the cmyth git
repository, and that you have a MythTV server running on "localhost".

libcmyth test code
------------------

This directory contains test programs for C++ and the SWIG language bindings
built upon libcppmyth.  The bash scripts assume that you have installed
libcmyth into a directory called "install" at the top of the cmyth git
repository, and that you have a MythTV server running on "localhost".

In order to override the default install location, use the PREFIX environment
variable.

In order to override the default MythTV server, provide it as an argument to
the bash script.

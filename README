libcmyth is a library implemented in C that allows you to communicate
with a MythTV backend.

In order to build everything, you will require the following:

	scons		- required to build anything
	swig		- required to build the various language binding
	MySQL		- required for MySQL access to MythTV backends
	javac		- required to build the Java bindings
	ndk-build	- required to build for Android
	Xcode & iOS SDK	- required to build for iOS

The build is controlled with scons, and there are several build targets
available (the default target will just build the code):

	cscope		- build a cscope database
	doxygen		- build doxygen documentation
	all		- build the code, cscope, and doxygen
	install		- build and install the code

If scons is unavailable on your system, you can install the scons-local package
from scons.org in the cmyth repository.

To build a target:

	$ scons <target>

To cleanup a target:

	$ scons -c <target>

To specify an install prefix:

	$ PREFIX=<path> scons install

To build for Android, set BUILD_ANDROID:

	$ BUILD_ANDROID=y scons

To build for iOS, set BUILD_IOS:

	$ BUILD_IOS=y scons

To specify a compiler other than gcc:

	$ CC=<compiler> scons
	$ CROSS=<cross compiler prefix> scons


================================================================================

Supported build environments include:

	  - Linux (gcc, clang)
	  - Mac OS X (gcc, clang, Xcode, iOS)
	  - Windows (Visual C++ 2010, cygwin)
	  - Android (with the Android SDK and NDK)


================================================================================

Bindings for languages other than C/C++/Objective-C:

	 - Clojure
	 - Common Lisp
	 - Java
	 - Lua
	 - Perl
	 - PHP
	 - Python
	 - Ruby

Please see the test directory for examples of using each language binding.

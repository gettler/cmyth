libcmyth is a library implemented in C that allows you to communicate
with a MythTV backend.

In order to build everything, you will require the following:

	scons		- required to build anything
	swig		- required to build the various language binding
	MySQL		- required for MySQL access to MythTV backends

The build is controlled with scons, and there are several build targets
available (the default target will just build the code):

	cscope		- build a cscope database
	doxygen		- build doxygen documentation
	all		- build the code, cscope, and doxygen
	install		- build and install the code

To build a target:

	$ scons <target>

To cleanup a target:

	$ scons -c <target>

To specify an install prefix:

	$ PREFIX=<path> scons install
